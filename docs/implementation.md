# Implementation guide (for agents)

Work top-to-bottom. Each step has a `[ ]` todo checklist and a **Deliverable** (what must exist and pass before moving on). Keep `swift build` and `swift test` green after every step. Cross-cutting invariants below are non-negotiable in every milestone.

## Cross-cutting invariants

- **Dedup by `message.id`, last-wins**, across all files (global dict). Streaming repeats the same id with identical token tuples.
- **Never sum `message.usage.iterations[]`** — it repeats the top-level counts. Decode only the four top-level usage fields.
- **Skip all-zero-token records;** drop records with no `message.id`; flag unknown models (don't silently zero cost).
- **Off-main scanning.** Parse/aggregate off the main actor; hand an immutable `Sendable` snapshot to the `@MainActor` `UsageStore`. Single-flight refreshes.
- **Headline tokens = input+output by default** (cache-reads are ~97% of the raw total). Limit math uses `billableTotal`.
- **Provider-neutral core.** No Claude-specific code outside `Providers/Claude/`.
- **Zero third-party dependencies.**

## M0 — Docs & scaffolding ✅

- [x] `docs/*` written (this set).
- [x] SPM package: `UsageCore` library + `UsageCoreTests`.
- [x] Core models: `TokenCounts`, `TokenDefinition`, `UsageEvent`, `ProviderID`.
- [x] `UsageProvider` protocol + `ProviderRegistry` + `ClaudeProvider` stub.
- [x] `PricingTable` with the Claude table + tests.
- **Deliverable:** `swift build` + `swift test` green. ✅

## M1 — Skeleton + one real number ✅

**Goal:** a correct, deduped "Tokens · This Month (input+output)" in the menu bar, off-main, on the real ~521 MB tree. *Validated: 34,793 deduped events, cold scan ~5.4s off-main; GUI confirmed showing 13.1M.*

1. **`JSONLReader`** (`Scanning/JSONLReader.swift`)
   - [x] Streams via `FileHandle` in ~256 KB chunks, splits on `\n`, yields complete lines as `Data`, retains the trailing partial.
   - [x] `seek(toOffset:)` resume; returns the new byte offset (for the M4 incremental scan).
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ tested — multi-line, resume-from-offset, partial-last-line, tiny-chunk fixtures.
2. **Claude record decoding** (`Providers/Claude/ClaudeRecord.swift`, `ClaudeProvider.parse`)
   - [x] Lenient `Decodable` mirror (all fields optional); `usage` decodes only the four top-level fields — `iterations` is intentionally not modeled (would double-count).
   - [x] `parse(line:)` keeps `type == "assistant"` with a non-empty `message.id` and non-zero tokens; tags `provider = .claude`; returns `nil` on anything unparseable.
   - [x] Timestamps parsed by a **manual integer ISO-8601-UTC parser** (`ClaudeTimestamp`), not a `DateFormatter` — faster and `Sendable`-safe; sub-second ignored.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ tests — dup id, ignored `iterations`, zero / missing-id / non-assistant / corrupt skipped, partial usage. Note: **unknown/`<synthetic>` models are KEPT** (flagged for cost in M3), not skipped.
3. **`UsageScanner`** (`Scanning/UsageScanner.swift`)
   - [x] Enumerates `*.jsonl` recursively (`FileManager.enumerator`); parses → global dedup map keyed by **`(provider, message.id)`**, last-wins → `[UsageEvent]`.
   - [x] Full cold scan (incremental `FileScanState` + mtime/size/byte-offset resume deferred to M4).
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ real tree returns 34,793 deduped events; runs off-main; tested for dedup + missing root.
4. **Aggregation** (`Aggregation/Period.swift`, `PeriodBucketer.swift`, `Aggregator.swift`, `UsageSnapshot.swift`)
   - [x] `Period {today, thisWeek, thisMonth, rolling7, rolling30}`; local-day bucketing by default with a `.utc` toggle; week start respects `firstWeekday`.
   - [x] `Aggregator`: single pass → `TokenCounts` per (period, model) into an immutable `UsageSnapshot`.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ tests for today/month membership, rolling-30 boundary, this-week, and per-period/per-model sums.
5. **`UsageStore`** (`Aggregation/UsageStore.swift`)
   - [x] `@MainActor @Observable`; `refresh()` runs the scan in a detached task and publishes the `Sendable` snapshot on the main actor; single-flight via an `isScanning` guard.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ exposes `snapshot.tokens(.thisMonth)`; starts empty/idle (tested).
6. **App** (`App/`, an **SPM executable target** — `swift run inline-usage`)
   - [x] `MenuBarExtra { MenuContentView } label: { Text(model.title) }`, `.menuBarExtraStyle(.window)`; Dock icon hidden via `.accessory` activation policy.
   - [x] Label shows the abbreviated value (K/M/B); dropdown shows the exact grouped value + `in · out · cache-rd` breakdown + Refresh/Quit; "Loading…" until the first scan completes.
   - [x] `--scan-once` headless mode (`Main.swift`) prints per-period totals and exits — the real-data smoke test.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ launches, shows the correct deduped 13.1M without stalling the menu bar.
   - *Deferred:* the distributable `.app` bundle with `LSUIElement` (M5); the dev build runs un-bundled via `swift run`. (The menu-bar label stays an inlined `Text` — no separate view needed.)

## M2 — Fast switch + settings + real-time ✅

*Built in two parts: M2a (selectable metric + fast-switch + settings) and M2b (real-time FSEvents + incremental scan). GUI confirmed; 36 tests green.*

1. **Selection model** (`Metrics/MetricSelection.swift`)
   - [x] `Metric {tokens, cost, limit5h, limitWeekly}` + `MetricSelection {provider, metric, period, tokenDefinition}`.
   - [x] Pure rendering: `render(from:)` (abbreviated), `renderExact(from:)` (grouped), `label`, `header`. Cost/limits render `—` until M3/M4.
   - [x] Persistence via `jsonString` / `init?(jsonString:)` — deliberately **not** `RawRepresentable<String>`: the stdlib's `Codable`-for-`RawRepresentable` default shadows the member-wise coding and recurses (`rawValue` → `encode(self)` → `rawValue` → …), a SIGBUS stack overflow that the round-trip test caught.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ tests — render-by-definition, period switch, labels/headers, cost/limit placeholders, JSON round-trip.
2. **Number formatting** (`Formatting/NumberFormatting.swift`)
   - [x] K/M/B abbreviation + grouped exact (landed in M1, with tests: 999 → "999", 1_500 → "1.5K", 38_214_556 → "38.2M").
   - [x] Currency formatting (`UsageFormat.cost` / `costExact`) — added in M3.
   - [ ] Integer-percent formatting (for the plan-limit metrics — M4).
3. **Fast-switch dropdown** (`App/MenuContentView.swift`)
   - [x] Quick-switch rows (token periods: Today / This Week / This Month / Last 30 Days) with live per-row values + a checkmark on the active one; one tap updates the selection. (Cost/limit rows join in M3/M4.)
   - [x] Recomputes from the in-memory snapshot on switch — no rescan.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ flipping rows updates the menu-bar value instantly.
4. **Real-time refresh** (`App/RefreshController.swift`)
   - [x] FSEvents recursive watch on each data root; ~400 ms debounce; triggers `UsageStore.refresh()`. (Limit-snapshot watch is M4.)
   - [x] Optional interval `Timer` for the non-real-time cadences (also advances rolling windows when idle).
   - [x] "Updates" setting: Real-time (default) / 1s / 2s / 5s / 10s / 30s.
   - [x] **Incremental scan pulled forward from M4** (`Scanning/ScanState.swift`, `UsageScanner+Incremental.swift`): re-stat all files, read only new/grown ones (resume from byte offset), accumulate into the deduped map. First pass full; later passes read a few KB — cheap enough to run on every change.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ a new Claude turn updates the menu bar within the debounce window; refresh is incremental, no main-thread stall.
5. **Settings + persistence** (`App/SettingsView.swift`)
   - [x] `Settings` scene with pickers: token metric, day boundaries (local/UTC), updates cadence.
   - [x] Persisted via **manual `UserDefaults`** (the whole selection as one JSON string; zone + interval as enum raw values) — not `@AppStorage`, which doesn't compose with `@Observable`.
   - **Deliverable:** ✅ settings persist across relaunch.

---

## M3 — Cost ✅

*GUI confirmed; 40 tests green. Cross-checked against the claude-usage dashboard (below).*

- [x] `CostCalculator` (`Pricing/CostCalculator.swift`): folds the per-model token map → `PricingTable.cost` per model → sum; unpriced models' billable tokens collect into `unknownModelTokens` (flagged, never zeroed into the total). The `Aggregator` bakes per-period `cost` + `unknownModelTokens` into the snapshot.
- [x] **Cost metric**: `MetricSelection` renders `.cost` (abbreviated `$4.8K`, exact `$4,774.94` via `UsageFormat.cost` / `costExact`); the quick-switch gains **Cost — This Month / Today** rows.
- [x] **Per-model breakdown** in the dropdown ("By model" — per-model tokens on a tokens view, per-model `$` on a cost view), largest first; plus an "excludes N tokens from unpriced models" note on cost views.
- [x] **Multi-root**: `ClaudeProvider` scans the Xcode `CodingAssistant` dir **when present** (existence-checked) — included-when-found rather than an `includeXcodeDir` toggle; an opt-out can come later.
- [x] `--scan-once` prints estimated cost per period (a headless cross-check aid).
- **Deliverable:** ✅ Last-30-days cost **$4,774.94** vs the dashboard's **$4,419.37** — the ~$355 delta is **fable-5**, which inline-usage prices ($10/$50) and `claude-usage` doesn't; accounting for that, the figures reconcile. Unknown-model flagging works (`<synthetic>` tokens surfaced).

---

## M4 — Plan limits

1. **Official path** (`Limits/LimitSource.swift`, `scripts/inline-usage-statusline.sh`)
   - [ ] Helper script reads Claude Code's status-line JSON on stdin and writes `{five_hour, seven_day, model, ts}` to `~/.claude/inline-usage/snapshot.json` (passing the input through if wrapping an existing command).
   - [ ] App offers one-click, opt-in registration into `~/.claude/settings.json`'s `statusLine` (wrap any existing command, with explicit consent); watch the snapshot via FSEvents.
   - **Deliverable:** with the hook on and Claude Code active, app 5h/7d % matches `/usage`.
2. **Estimate fallback** (`Limits/FiveHourWindower.swift`, `LimitEstimator.swift`, `PlanLimits.swift`)
   - [ ] Group sorted events into rolling 5h blocks (start at first activity, last 5h). Active block = the one containing `now` (clamp future timestamps).
   - [ ] Budget = custom (user) → P90 of historical block sums (`billableTotal`) → plan multiplier seed. % = used / budget, labeled "estimate".
   - [ ] Weekly = rolling-7-day sum ÷ weekly budget.
   - **Deliverable:** with the hook off, a labeled estimate renders; window-grouping unit tests pass.
3. **Persisted incremental scan** (extends the in-memory scan pulled into M2)
   - [x] In-memory incremental scan — skip unchanged files, resume grown from `byteOffset`, accumulate deduped events — landed in **M2** (real-time needs it).
   - [ ] Persist `FileScanState` across launches so the first post-launch scan is also incremental; refine shrink/rotate handling.
   - **Deliverable:** met in-session in M2 (a refresh after one new turn reads a few KB); cross-launch persistence remaining.
- [ ] Menu-bar color/symbol turns orange/red past 80%/100%.

---

## M5 — Polish & notarize

- [ ] `SMAppService.mainApp` launch-at-login toggle.
- [ ] Empty/first-run state (no `~/.claude` → friendly "No data"); timezone setting; refresh-interval polish.
- [ ] **Prereq:** install a Developer ID Application cert. Then: sign (`--options runtime`, no sandbox) → build `.dmg` → `notarytool submit --wait` → `stapler staple` → verify `spctl`. See `distribution.md`.
- **Deliverable:** a notarized `.dmg` that launches clean on a second Mac.

---

## M6 — Additional providers (post-MVP)

- [ ] `Providers/Codex/CodexProvider.swift`, `Providers/Gemini/GeminiProvider.swift` conforming to `UsageProvider`; discover each CLI's data location, record format, and pricing.
- [ ] Add them to `ProviderRegistry`; add provider scope to the menu (per-provider / All).
- **Deliverable:** Codex/Gemini usage shows behind the same UI with no core changes.
